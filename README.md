# Whamageddon Bot

For shenanigans.

## Usage

1. Invite "AndyGeorgeBot" to your Discord server
2. Type `!wham my-voice-channel` in a text channel, where `my-voice-channel` is the name of the voice channel to Wham. If the voice channel name has spaces in it, wrap the name in quotes first, e.g. `!wham "my voice channel"`.
3. Enjoy!
